# Contributing to the SE701 Team 1 Project

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Ground Rules
This project and everyone participating in it is follows our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are also expected to uphold this code.

### Fork and pull method
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

## Getting started
### Give them a quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution.
[insert resources for fork and pill method]

How you write this is up to you, but some things you may want to include:

* If tests are required for contributions, let them know, and explain how to run the tests
* If you use anything other than GitHub to manage issues (ex. JIRA or Trac), let them know which tools they’ll need to contribute

>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.

## How to report a bug
### Tell your contributors how to file a bug report.
You can even include a template so people can just copy-paste (again, less work for you).

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of Go are you using (go version)?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement
### Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature.
If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why it’s needed and how it might work.

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Elasticsearch, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Elasticsearch has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Code review process
### Explain how a contribution gets accepted after it’s been submitted.
Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before it’s accepted? When should a contributor expect to hear from you? How can contributors get commit access, if at all?

## Code, commit message and labeling conventions
These sections are not necessary, but can help streamline the contributions you receive.

### Explain your preferred style for code, if you have any.

### Explain if you use any labeling conventions for issues.
