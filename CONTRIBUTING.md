# Contributing to the SE701 Team 1 Project

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! 

## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is follows our Code of Conduct[link here]. By participating, you are also expected to uphold its standards and are subject to its enforcement guidelines.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License.

## Getting started
We use GitHub issues associated with each project to track the work associated with that project. Check the issue comments/labels to see whether someone else has indicated that they are working on it. If the issue has been assigned then it is not available to pick up. 

All code or documentation contributions should be associated with an open issue. If an issue does not exist for the area you wish to work on, one should be created first.

### Issues 
#### Creating an issue
Check if the bug report, feature or documentation contribution does not already have an open issue. If not then a new issue can be created using the issue template linked [here](insert link later). 

For a new feature request, the issue should describe the new feature and why it is needed. For bug reports, provide as much information as possible so that the others will be able to reproduce it. 

The issue should then be approved by the team, and assigned labels, before assigning a member to work on it.

#### Issue Labeling
The labels available for issues fall under 3 categories, Priority, Status and Type. All issues must have one of each category at all times. The priority label should be decided by the team working on the relevant issue. During development please update the issue as required.

### Suggested Workflow
This project uses the fork and pull workflow. For more details see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT8KGYVurIU).

1. Fork and clone the main project repository 
2. Create a new branch off main when starting work on a new issue.
3. Commit your changes in the feature branch in your local clone.
4. Update your local repository with the most recent code from the main repository. Remember to rebase often
5. Test your changes (if applicable) â€“ run all existing tests and any new tests, and make sure the application works as expected. 
6. Create a pull request. (See below sections for a template) 
7. Another team member must review and approve of the pull request.  
8. Merge your changes

### PR Templates
Insert pr request template here. Pull requests should be created to merge all changes. Other team members will review the proposed code and suggest changes as required. Discussions about the code should be kept to the relevant issue/PR so that all team members can see and benefit from it.

## Code review process
Team members in the relevant sub-team will review the code submitted for PR. Team members will review code for readability, style, bugs, test coverage and completion of acceptance criteria.
