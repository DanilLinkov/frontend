## Getting started
All code or documentation contributions should be associated with an open issue. If an issue does not exist, you should create one first. 

### Issues 
#### Creating an issue
Firstly please check if the bug report, feature or documentation contribution does not already have an open issue. If not then a new issue can be created using the issue template linked [here](insert link later). For a new feature request, the issue should describe the new feature and why it is needed. For bug reports, provide as much information as possible so that the others will be able to reproduce it.

The issue should then be approved by the team, and assigned labels, before assigning a member to work on it.

#### Issue Labeling
The labels available for issues fall under 3 categories, Priority, Status and Type. All issues must have one of each category at all times. The priority label should be decided by the team working on the relevant issue. During development please update the issue as required.

1. Fork and clone the main project repository 
2. Create a new branch off main when starting work on a new issue.
3. Commit your changes in the feature branch in your local clone.
4. Update your local repository with the most recent code from the main repository. Remember to rebase often
5. Test your changes (if applicable) â€“ run all existing tests and any new tests, and make sure the application works as expected. 
6. Create a pull request. (See below sections for a template) 
7. Another team member must review and approve of the pull request.  
8. Merge your changes
